## 2023

* BalticGIT: [Getting POI from OSM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvB1V2ifLCY). See below for a better version.
* FOSS4G: [How to get points of interest from OSM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQwO-vbGre0).
  An in-depth review of mapping and tagging practices of OSM, how it fares against proprietary POI providers, and what one needs to know to use the data.
* FOSS4G: [What in-game maps can teach us](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgsQbdg96LI).
  An impromptu talk made on Nintendo Switch about in-game maps, how do they work, and how they are different from real world maps.

## 2022

* BalticGIT: [You don't need a map](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2PNtVmDa3ps).
  Maps are common in geospatial and other tools, but do we always need them? Sometimes an image or a list work much better.

## 2021

* State of the Map: [Map-Less Map Editors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjwTR5sSHN8).
  I made a Telegram bot for editing the map, which posed a question: why do we even need interactive maps?
  And is it possible to make a better POI editor for OpenStreetMap?

## 2019

* FOSDEM: [Hundred thousand rides a day](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QR4P3p8eKho).
  In Juno we validated NYC road network and fixed all the errors, and also published GPS traces from all our taxi drivers.
* SotM US: [Keeping New York road map perfect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHWZxrqaGM8).
  Same about Juno activity in NYC, but from a more local angle.
* SotM US: [You don't know OpenStreetMap](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BE9vbI6_PAU).
  Common knowledge about OSM and how it isn't always true. "Map is free", "anybody can map", "events build communities" and so on. Do they?

## 2017

* FOSDEM: [How to break the OpenStreetMap](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY0cDm9BISo).
  Releasing an editor in MAPS.ME was great, but also lead to few issues that stem from OSM data model and community.
  It really wasn't equipped with dealing with so many edits and new users. We need better monitoring and other tools.
* SotM Tanzania: [MAPS.ME](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=929vQDkB4Es).
  How I made a build for Tanzania, few hints on how the editor works, and a few words on place reviews.

## 2016

* SotM US: [Millions that don't care](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjACliEeR4Q).
  How Maps.Me built-in editor will change the mapping in OSM and how we leverage millions of untrained mappers.

# 2014

* SotM EU: [I've bought a car for mapping, now what?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JtCBzoPML0).
  Yes you move fast and can cover thousands of kilometers. But how do you map while behind the wheel?
  Or even in a passenger seat, surely there are better ways than drawing in a notebook?
