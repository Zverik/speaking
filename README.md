# I Speak

## 2023

* BalticGIT: [Getting POI from OSM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvB1V2ifLCY). See below for a better version.
* FOSS4G: [How to get points of interest from OSM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQwO-vbGre0).
  An in-depth review of mapping and tagging practices of OSM, how it fares against proprietary POI providers, and what one needs to know to use the data.
* FOSS4G: [What in-game maps can teach us](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgsQbdg96LI).
  An impromptu talk made on Nintendo Switch about in-game maps, how do they work, and how they are different from real world maps.

## 2022

* FOSDEM: [A Better Public Transport App](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bke2ATCHJ1Q).
  Explaining how I built [Easy Transit](https://easytransit.app), why the UX is best in class, and which
  open source data and libraries helped me.
* BalticGIT: [You don't need a map](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2PNtVmDa3ps).
  Maps are common in geospatial and other tools, but do we always need them? Sometimes an image or a list work much better.
* State of the Map: [Every Door and the future of POI in OSM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuniBNwynEs).
  The history of Every Door development, why open data is daunting to work with, but open source helps.
* FOSS4G: [Surveying amenities for OSM at scale](https://talks.osgeo.org/foss4g-2022/talk/DTJSU3/) (no video yet).
  Outlines OSM tagging model, how it's different from proprietary offers, and how Every Door will change how we
  look at OSM data quality and coverage.

## 2021

* FOSDEM: [Telegram Bot For Navigation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_yGcTXODek).
  About my "Na Rayone" Telegram bot, which helped me map 400 shops around and produce an
  exciting database of addresses and amenities with a search.
* State of the Map: [Map-Less Map Editors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjwTR5sSHN8).
  I made a Telegram bot for editing the map, which posed a question: why do we even need interactive maps?
  And is it possible to make a better POI editor for OpenStreetMap?

## 2020

* FOSDEM: [Reverse Geocoding Is Not Easy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjE6xy0BBgc).
  I made a reverse geocoder on OpenStreetMap data in Juno, using only PostGIS. And it's better
  than any alternatives because it uses polygonal geometry.
* ByGIS: [Общаться с OpenStreetMap. Как?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7amsK-poIu0) ("Communicating with OpenStreetMap. How?").
  Following some thoughts from FOSDEM, here I explain how communications works in open source
  projects and OSM specifically. "Company goals almost never align with OSM values".
* State of the Map: [Send Me A Postcard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rx92sVvDVtc).
  About the OSM Cards website for postcrossing between OSMers.

## 2019

* FOSDEM: [Hundred thousand rides a day](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QR4P3p8eKho).
  In Juno we validated NYC road network and fixed all the errors, and also published GPS traces from all our taxi drivers.
* ByGIS: [Святой источник](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1VqTK0fmv_s) ("Holy source").
  OpenStreetMap is drawn using outdated GPS traces and outdated satellite imagery. Can that be overturned?
  Juno helps: it published a day-old dataset for GPS traces in New York.
* ByGIS: [Аэрофотосъёмка без дронов и самолётов](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=En0SlwyqEPU) ("Aerial photos without drones or planes").
  A story on how in 2012 we had a mapping party in Vyshniy Volochyok, where we also lifted a camera
  with a helium-filled baloon and then stitched some photos from it together.
* ByGIS: [Обратный геокодер — это непросто](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwUZkUkpITk) ("Reverse Geocoding Is Not Simple").
  How hard it is to make a reverse geocoder on OpenStreetMap data? Turns out, polygonal addresses
  introduce a new level of complexity.
* State of the Map: [Reverse Geocoding Is Not Simple](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dqr_b8-sbbM).
  A lightning talk version of my ByGIS talk.
* State of the Map: [Broken Promises and Technical Difficulties](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aRcHLKbXlcM).
  OpenStreetMap data model is good, but we can do better. Few things that need fixing: history and object versions,
  back references, restoring deleted objects, atomic changes and so on.
* State of the Map: [Share the Word](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2S80J1n5w0).
  My experience in sharing OSM news and thoughts: about a blog, a podcast, a radio, a telegram channel.
* State of the Map: OpenStreetMap Awards 2019 (no video: held at a social event).
* SotM US: [Keeping New York road map perfect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHWZxrqaGM8).
  Same about Juno activity in NYC, but from a more local angle.
* SotM US: [You don't know OpenStreetMap](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BE9vbI6_PAU).
  Common knowledge about OSM and how it isn't always true. "Map is free", "anybody can map", "events build communities" and so on. Do they?
* School in Homyel: [Урок по основам OpenStreetMap от Juno Lab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=469pkgFDYhk) ("OpenStreetMap basics lesson").
  A re-recording of a talk I gave to school children on the basics of mapping: how maps are drawn,
  for what they are used and so on.
* SotM SEE: OpenStreetMapS (no video, slides pending).
  We see OSM as a single project, but every community has its rules, every editor has its devotees.
  Also it's pretty hard to include people who don't speak English or don't need open geodata.
* SotM SEE: Open Licenses (no video, slides pending).
  An improptu lightning talk on ODbL license and its shenanigans.

## 2018

* FOSDEM: [Every Subway Network In The World](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFYH3I7WNnM).
  How I fixed the public transport schema for subways in OSM, wrote a parser, and
  with a help of few mappers made subway routing possible in Maps.Me.
* State of the Map: [What's up with the public transport](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLTqdHx_Psw).
  Looks at the tagging schema for public transport, highlights its issues, and proposes a better one.
* State of the Map: [Every Day I'm Mapping](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UndzHhfQL3I).
  Some OSM Streak history and statistics.
* State of the Map: [Public transport in OSM, BoF session](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcyTjidjhZY).
  Basically ensuring everybody the refined public transport schema would work.
* State of the Map: [OpenStreetMap Awards 2018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ean7eETd4TM).
* ByGIS: [Невероятные приключения общественного транспорта в OSM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TRZu96pGw8) ("Incredible adventures of public transport in OSM").
  Roughly the same as the SotM talk: how the current public transport schema is bad and how the new one can fix everything.

## 2017

* FOSDEM: [How to break the OpenStreetMap](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY0cDm9BISo).
  Releasing an editor in MAPS.ME was great, but also lead to few issues that stem from OSM data model and community.
  It really wasn't equipped with dealing with so many edits and new users. We need better monitoring and other tools.
* SotM Tanzania: [MAPS.ME](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=929vQDkB4Es).
  How I made a build for Tanzania, few hints on how the editor works, and a few words on place reviews.
* ByGIS: [Чужих данных нам не надо](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbAzoz-Hu24) ("We don't need no data").
  A three-part examination of importing practices in OpenStreetMap, what went wrong and how the community
  built around that, and finally look at OSM Conflator, a new POI importing tool that follows the guidelines.
* State of the Map: [Before maturity comes puberty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2S80J1n5w0).
  Companies are starting to use OSM a lot, but the community is rebellious. We need time to accept and grow.
* State of the Map: [Mapping well with MAPS.ME and how people fail at that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87D7CpsAWn8&t=84s).
  Few non-obvious things about Maps.Me built-in editor: notes, advanced opening hours, names.
* State of the Map: [Mapping Rivers](https://speakerdeck.com/sotm2017/day3-0930-lt-rivers) (no video).
  A lightning talk version of my Schemotechnika talk on mapping underground rivers in Moscow.
* State of the Map: OpenStreetMap Awards 2017 (no video: held at a social event).

## 2016

  to watch them.
* State of the Map: [OpenStreetMap Awards 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwzZ5SMJXxY).

# 2014

* SotM EU: [I've bought a car for mapping, now what?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JtCBzoPML0).
  Yes you move fast and can cover thousands of kilometers. But how do you map while behind the wheel?
  Or even in a passenger seat, surely there are better ways than drawing in a notebook?
* ОМММ: [OSM проваливает (помимо прочего) социалку](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2a7qp-K2Cg4) ("OSM fails social, among other things").
  Despite its focus on community, OSM neglects doing anything to bring people together. In this talk I suggests
  some things, e.g. messaging API, diary subscriptions, groups, geochat etc.
* ОМММ: [MapBBCode](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2MFeOdxXY8).
  A story of a forum plugin for adding and sharing maps, and the accompanying tools.
